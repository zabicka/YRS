HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Install isn't ready to use and you must install YRS by your hand.
It's easy - open files db.php.default, settings.php.default and .htaccess.default, set it and
remove ".default" from its name.

Then run file password.php in dir with YRS with your root's password past the ?
(e.g. write in your browser: http://localhost/YRS/password.php?secret_password).
Find "GENERATE YOUR PASSWORD" in yrs.sql.default and replace it - write hash from password.php.
You can remove file password.php.

Then import file yrs.sql.default to your DB and run YRS. You can login with user name "root" and
with your password.

Lot of fun :).
